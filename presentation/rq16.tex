\begin{frame}{Intervention by Unhelpful Plan Prefix Recognition}
Assumptions
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathrm{d}$ is user's goal, $\mathrm{u}$ is the  undesirable goal
\item The observer has full observability of the actors' actions.
\item The observer knows about $\mathrm{d}$  and $\mathrm{u}$ and helps the user avoid $\mathrm{u}$ 
\item $\mathrm{u}$  is unknown to the user. 
\item $\mathrm{d}$  is unknown to the competitor (if present)
\item User can not recognize effects of competitor's actions. Some of user's own actions may have hidden effects
\item User follows a satisficing plan to reach $\mathrm{d}$, and may reach $\mathrm{u}$  unwittingly
\end{itemize}
The recognition problem \\
\textit{\textbf{Given the action history ($o_1, \ldots ,o_{i-1}$), and the proposed action $o_i$ must the prefix ($o_1, \ldots ,o_{i-1}$) be flagged to help the user avoid $\mathrm{u}$}?}
