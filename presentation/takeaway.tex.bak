\begin{frame}{The Main Takeaway}
\begin{itemize}
\item The problem
\begin{itemize}
\item An agent is executing a plan online (user)
\item The environment has some conditions that may allow the user's plan to be subverted (e.g., hidden information, an attacker)
\item A passive observer monitoring the agent(s) actions must recognize in advance the user's plan will have an undesirable outcome
\end{itemize}

\item Research contribution
\begin{itemize}
\item Use characteristics of the planning problem representation to learn when intervention is required
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
