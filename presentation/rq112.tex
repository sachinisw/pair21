\begin{frame}{Inferring an Agent's Goal}
\textit{Given the three moves (up,up,diagonal) from I to F, is the actor's plan likely to reach A or B}?\\

Find the cost difference between:
\begin{itemize}
\item A plan going to the goal that includes the observations $(G|O)$
\item A plan going to the goal that does not include the observations $(G|\overline{\rm O})$
\end{itemize}

Cost difference A $>$ cost difference B $\rightarrow$ likely goal B
