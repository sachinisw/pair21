	\item Summary
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Intervention is as important as recognition
		\item Formalize the intervention problem in competitive domains and train a decision tree using domain-independant features to identify critical actions
		\item Explain intervention using natural language templates generated from a rule base
		\end{itemize}
		
		\item Future Work
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Adopt different sampling strategies and new features to handle large domains (search and rescue)
			\item Relax optimality constraints, uncertainty in the environment and threat models
			\item Integrating causality to explanations and user studies
		\end{itemize}
