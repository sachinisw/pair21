\begin{frame}{Why Study Intervention In Cyber-security?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Regardless the perceived self-efficacy and cues, human users can still end up compromising security.
\item Intervention solution need to address:
\begin{itemize}
\item Users do not complete tasks methodically (e.g., repeated actions, skips)
\item Intervention decisions must be made for each observation
\item Need to evaluate proximity to an exploit irrespective of the user's goal
\end{itemize}
\item Proposed solution:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sample the solution space using an automated planner
\item Design metrics to associate actions with exploits
\item Combine the metrics into a function that produces a ``criticality'' measure for an action
\item Interrupt based on the ``criticality'' measure
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
