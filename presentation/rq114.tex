\begin{frame}{Intervention with Existing Goal Recognition Algorithms}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use \textbf{plan recognition as planning} and \textbf{goal mirroring} to recognize likely goals given observations
\item If the likely goal is $\mathrm{u}$, then intervene
\item Results
\begin{itemize}
\item Reporting F-score and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) for benchmark planning domains (Blocks words, EasyIPC, Ferry)
\item Many false negatives/positives occur when the undesirable state is close to the desirable state in the state space.
\item Low accuracy in recognizing when intervention is required
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
