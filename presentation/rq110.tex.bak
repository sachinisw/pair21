\begin{frame}{Learning to Intervene}
\begin{itemize}
\item Two feature sets:
\begin{itemize}
\item metrics from the intervention graph
\item similarity metrics from the sampled plans
\end{itemize}
\item Use the feature sets to train classifiers to recognize actions that should be flagged for intervention
\begin{itemize}
\item Naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbor, Decision tree, Logistic regression
\end{itemize}
\item Use the classifiers to recognize intervention in unseen problems
\end{itemize}
