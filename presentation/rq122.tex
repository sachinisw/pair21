\begin{frame}{Key Findings}
\begin{itemize}
\item Behavior patterns in unsafe solutions
\begin{itemize}
\item Moving the same car back and forth in succession (do/undo)
\item Making moves that clears space around the forbidden vehicle
\item Lengthy solution
\end{itemize}
\item Propose features to predict unsafe behavior
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of moves
\item Number of moves - Number of moves in the optimal solution
\item Number of times a move was immediately undone
\item Number of times free spaces around the forbidden vehicle increased
\item Number of times the number of vehicles blocking the goal car increased
\item Number of times the board was reset to the original configuration
\end{itemize}
