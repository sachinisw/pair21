Intervening is common in online assistive agents and safety critical decision making, where an observer determines how to guide a user toward a desirable outcome. Intervention extends plan recognition to account for the goals of the user
as well as undesirable outcomes. We formalize the plan intervention problem and characterize the observerâ€™s decision space as an Intervention Graph, from which we extract domain-independent features to assess critical actions lead-
ing to undesirable outcomes. We apply these features to learn whether to intervene in online scenarios while varying undesirable outcomes. In several benchmark problems, the learned models dominate three recent plan recognition approaches,
although the performance varies by the application. To our knowledge, this is the first work to incorporate plan recognition for intervention, which lays a foundation for further applications of plan recognition for assistive and decision sup-
port agents.
