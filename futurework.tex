\section{Summary and Future Work}

We formalized the online plan intervention problem and proposed exact and approximate solutions, which model the decision space for the observer whose objective is to help the user. We trained a classifier using domain-independent features extracted from the models and evaluated how commonly accepted interpretable classifiers perform in predicting intervention. Both methods outperform existing online plan/goal recognition approaches with lower false positives and false negatives. We also augmented intervention model to explain intervention using causality. As future work we will extend the intervention model to identify mitigating actions (i.e., time horizon $>$1) and relax full observability. %in the domain.
